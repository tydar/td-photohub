# Big Picture

## TODO

* Refactor upload filename access to consistently use app config values and Image filename helper

## Configuration notes

For running regular instance:

* Currently expects a postgres instance with username, password, and database `big_picture`.

For running a test instance:

* Expects a postgres instance with username and password `big_picture` and database `big_picture_test`.
